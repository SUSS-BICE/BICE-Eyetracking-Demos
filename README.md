# BICE_Eyetracking_Demos
A repository of eyetracking demos utilising Pupil lab's Neon glasses created by members of SUSS's Behavioural Insights Centre of Excellence (BICE)
Hi! This repository is currently private. This means only account users can see it. The idea is to make it public (if you'd like) so members of public can view works and output produced by the future Methods Lab. Here are some pros and cons

Pros: You can host your scripts here on GitHub such that any platform may access it. I'll demo an experiment for you on Qualtrics

Cons: Since it's accessible to the public, any materials such as images that are protected under RCA cannot be hosted on here

Otherwise, this is also a place where we can host tutorials for R Studio, Python etc. Software is always updating so GitHub's commit function makes it easier to update scripts as you go. Instead of having to download, change, upload etc
